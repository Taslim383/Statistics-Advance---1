    "1. What is a random variable in probability theory?\n",
    "→ A variable that takes numerical values based on outcomes of a random experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the types of random variables?\n",
    "→ Discrete (countable values) and Continuous (values in an interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the difference between discrete and continuous distributions?\n",
    "→ Discrete: specific outcomes. Continuous: range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are probability distribution functions (PDF)?\n",
    "→ PDF gives likelihood of a continuous variable within a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How do cumulative distribution functions (CDF) differ from PDFs?\n",
    "→ CDF: probability up to a point. PDF: density at a point (continuous only).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is a discrete uniform distribution?\n",
    "→ All outcomes equally likely. Example: fair die.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What are the key properties of a Bernoulli distribution?\n",
    "→ Outcomes: 0 and 1. Mean = p, Variance = p(1-p).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What is the binomial distribution, and how is it used in probability?\n",
    "→ Successes in n Bernoulli trials. Used in repeated yes/no experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What is the Poisson distribution and where is it applied?\n",
    "→ Events in a fixed interval. Example: calls per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is a continuous uniform distribution?\n",
    "→ All values in [a, b] equally likely. PDF = 1/(b-a).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?\n",
    "→ Bell-shaped, symmetric, defined by mean and SD.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the standard normal distribution, and why is it important?\n",
    "→ Mean = 0, SD = 1. Used for Z-score calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and why is it critical?\n",
    "→ Sample means follow normal distribution if sample is large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How does the CLT relate to the normal distribution?\n",
    "→ CLT allows use of normal distribution for sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the application of Z statistics in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "→ Measures how far sample mean is from population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. How do you calculate a Z-score, and what does it represent?\n",
    "→ Z = (X - μ) / σ. Shows distance from mean in SDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What are point and interval estimates in statistics?\n",
    "→ Point: single value. Interval: range (e.g., confidence interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "18. What is the significance of confidence intervals?\n",
    "→ Range where parameter is likely to lie, with certain confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What is the relationship between a Z-score and confidence interval?\n",
    "→ Z-score helps compute margin of error in confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How are Z-scores used to compare different distributions?\n",
    "→ Standardizes values for comparison across distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. What are the assumptions for applying the CLT?\n",
    "→ Independent, random samples, large sample size, finite mean & variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "22. What is the concept of expected value?\n",
    "→ Average outcome: E(X) = Σ x·P(x) or ∫ x·f(x) dx.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. How does a probability distribution relate to expected outcome?\n",
    "→ Expected value is the average based on distribution's probabilities.\n"
